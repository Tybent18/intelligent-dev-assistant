# AI Assistant Toolkit

A modular framework for building intelligent software assistants focused on reasoning, debugging, and developer support.

## Vision
This project explores how AI agents can assist with:
- Code analysis and debugging
- Pattern recognition in software behavior
- Structured reasoning over inputs
- Tool-augmented intelligence

## Core Concepts
- Agent-based design
- Modular tool interfaces
- Extensible reasoning layers
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
